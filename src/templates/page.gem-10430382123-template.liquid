BIBaDO was created after failing, no matter how hard I tried, to keep my identical twin girls clean during the weaning process and beyond.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;"><br></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;">I was extremely frustrated by the lack of choice for weaning bibs. Nothing seemed to stop the food I lovingly prepared for my daughters being dropped, spilt, and thrown all over the place, (banana stains do not come out in the wash).  The high chair was splattered in food as well as a two-meter blast zone around it!  Clearing up from three mealtimes a day, which often included a full outfit change, was precious time I did not have.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;"><br></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;">I finally had the ta-dah moment of how to create a simple product that could potentially change the lives of Mums and Dads all over the country. After many prototypes (which started off as a cut up umbrella) we finally have a BIBaDO ready to face the challenges of meal times especially for you and your little one. Throughout the development process we have worked closely with mums across the UK - so BIBaDO really is a product made by mums for mums!​&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;"><br></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;">We are so proud of our product and only very recently launched. My proudest achievement throughout the journey with BIBaDO is when Mums and Dads tell me how BIBaDO has changed mealtimes for them.  It has taken them from feeling frustrated and worried about the mess their child is making, to being able to enjoy their little one explore and discover their food as they learn about eating - we're just so pleased that we've been able to help!​&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;"><br></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Our product has undergone rigorous safety tests and complies with Article1,2 and 3 of the General Product Safety Directive 2001/95/EC​&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;"><br></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Here's to lots of meal times with less of the mess and more of the fun and maybe even finishing that cuppa!!!​Rachel xxx"</span><br></p></div></div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div data-label="Row" id="r-1514165030441" class="gf_row gf_row-gap-0" data-icon="gpicon-row" data-id="1514165030441" data-extraclass="" data-row-gap="0px"><div class="gf_column gf_col-md-6" id="c-1514165030334" data-id="1514165030334" style="min-height: auto;"><div data-label="Row" id="r-1514165030438" class="gf_row gf_row-gap-0" data-icon="gpicon-row" data-id="1514165030438" data-row-gap="0px" data-extraclass=""><div class="gf_col-md-12 gf_column" id="c-1514165030365" data-id="1514165030365" style="min-height: auto;"><div data-label="Heading" id="e-1514165030351" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-heading" data-id="1514165030351"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-center"><h1 style="text-align: left;"><font color="#1c1c25" style="">A New Experience of Flavor</font></h1></div></div><div data-label="Text Block" id="e-1514165030418" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-id="1514165030418"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left"><p style="text-align: left;">Coffee tastes have changed so much that I remember around 2012, introducing a much more acidic coffee into our blend thinking we were going to lead customers into a new experience of flavour, only to be dismayed on day one with customer’s dissatisfaction with a fruitier and more flavourful coffee. Coffee is after all the seed of a fruit. From then on, we began to work at a gradual pace, turning up the brightness a little, season after season. Today we can proudly craft a coffee with notes of lemon meringue, strawberry or passionfruit and find people on all sides of the counter are learning and developing their pallets.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="gf_column gf_col-md-6" id="c-1514165030397" data-id="1514165030397" style="min-height: auto;"><div data-label="Image" id="e-1514165030443" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-image" data-id="1514165030443"><div class="elm gf-elm-right" data-exc=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2005/9307/t/17/assets/gem20171224about1section2.jpg?13602612240069926255" alt="" class="gf_image" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable="1"></div></div></div></div>
